## Project Overview

This project implements a complete machine learning pipeline to predict which products a customer will reorder in their next shopping basket on Instacart. The system follows a structured approach: SQL-based feature engineering using DuckDB, training multiple classification models (LogisticRegression, XGBoost, LightGBM), and generating an HTML performance report.

**Business Objective:** Predict the probability that a user will reorder each product they have previously purchased, enabling personalized product recommendations and inventory optimization.

**Target Performance:** ROC-AUC ≥ 0.83 with Order-F1 improvement over baseline approaches.

## Learning Project Approach

This is a **student learning project**  emphasizing educational clarity over optimization. The implementation style reflects a junior data scientist's learning journey with:

- **Learning-oriented Explanations:** Comments explain WHY decisions are made, not just WHAT the code does
- **Verbose Clarity:** Prefer `user_last_prior_ord` over `ulpo`, `times_reordered` over `tr`
- **Step-by-step Logic:** Break complex operations into clearly documented intermediate steps
- **Beginner-friendly Structure:** Code should be approachable for someone learning ML pipelines

## Three-Command Reproduction Workflow

The entire pipeline can be reproduced with exactly three commands:

```bash
# 1. Build feature dataset from CSV files using SQL
python src/build_dataset.py

# 2. Train a model (choose: logreg, xgb, or lgbm)
python src/train.py --model logreg
python src/train.py --model xgb  
python src/train.py --model lgbm

# 3. Generate performance report and leaderboard
python src/report.py
```

### Alternative: Makefile Orchestration

For production-ready orchestration, use the Makefile commands:

```bash
# Build features with data validation
make build

# Train specific model with configuration
make train MODEL=xgb

# Generate comprehensive reports
make report

# Run end-to-end validation
make validate

# Clean intermediate files
make clean
```

### Configuration Management

The pipeline uses centralized configuration via `config.yaml`:

```yaml
data:
  raw_path: "data/raw"
  features_path: "data/features"
  
sampling:
  max_users: null  # null = no sampling
  random_seed: 42
  
models:
  default_topk: 10
  xgboost:
    n_estimators: 2000
    learning_rate: 0.05
    
logging:
  level: "INFO"
```

**Configuration Override Examples:**
```bash
# Override config values via command line
python src/train.py --model xgb --override models.xgboost.n_estimators=1000

# Use custom config file
python src/report.py --config custom_config.yaml
```

### Setup Instructions

1. **Create and activate virtual environment:**
```bash
# Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# Unix/macOS
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

2. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Ensure data files are in place:**
```
data/
├── orders.csv
├── order_products__prior.csv
├── order_products__train.csv
├── products.csv
├── aisles.csv
└── departments.csv
```

## Data Schema and Features

### Input Data Schema
- **orders.csv:** User order history with timing information
- **order_products__prior.csv:** Products in historical orders (for feature engineering)
- **order_products__train.csv:** Products in final orders (for labels only)
- **products.csv:** Product catalog with aisle/department mappings
- **aisles.csv:** Product aisle categories
- **departments.csv:** Product department categories

### Engineered Features
The SQL-based feature engineering creates 15 columns, of which 12 are used as ML features (excluding user_id, product_id, y):

**User-Product Interaction Features:**
- `times_bought`: Total number of times user purchased this product
- `times_reordered`: Number of times user reordered this product (excludes first purchase)
- `user_prod_reorder_rate`: Reorder rate for this specific user-product combination
- `last_prior_ordnum`: Order number of last purchase (recency indicator)
- `orders_since_last`: Number of orders since last purchase of this product
- `avg_add_to_cart_pos`: Average position in cart when user adds this product
- `avg_days_since_prior`: Average days between user's orders

**Product Popularity Features:**
- `prod_cnt`: Global popularity (total times product was purchased)
- `prod_users`: Number of unique users who purchased this product

**Categorical Features:**
- `aisle_id`: Product aisle category
- `department_id`: Product department category

**Target Variable:**
- `y`: Binary label (1 if product was reordered in train set, 0 otherwise)

**Note:** `user_id` and `product_id` are excluded from ML training to prevent overfitting. Product information is captured through aggregated features (`prod_cnt`, `prod_users`, `prod_avg_reorder_rate`) and categorical features (`aisle_id`, `department_id`).

## Methodology

### Data Leakage Prevention
**Critical Design Decision:** Strict separation between feature engineering and label generation:
- **Features:** Built exclusively from 'prior' orders (historical data)
- **Labels:** Generated only from 'train' orders (target outcomes)
- **Validation:** GroupShuffleSplit on user_id prevents user leakage between train/validation sets

This ensures the model cannot "cheat" by seeing future information during training.

### Evaluation Approach
The pipeline uses multiple complementary metrics:

1. **ROC-AUC:** Standard binary classification metric
2. **PR-AUC:** Precision-Recall AUC, better for imbalanced datasets
3. **F1@0.5:** F1 score at 0.5 probability threshold
4. **Order-F1@top-k:** Custom set-based metric that measures how well we predict the actual set of reordered products per user

**Order-F1 Calculation:**
```python
# For each user:
true_set = {products actually reordered}
pred_set = {top-k predicted products}
f1_user = 2 * |intersection| / (|true_set| + |pred_set|)

# Final metric:
order_f1 = mean(f1_user across all users)
```

This metric captures the business objective: predicting the right set of products per user, not just individual product probabilities.

### Model Selection
Three complementary approaches:
- **LogisticRegression:** Fast baseline with interpretable coefficients
- **XGBoost:** Gradient boosting with excellent tabular performance  
- **LightGBM:** Memory-efficient alternative to XGBoost

All models use the same preprocessing pipeline:
- **StandardScaler:** Normalize numeric features
- **OneHotEncoder:** Handle categorical features (aisle_id, department_id)

#### Feature Engineering Transformations

**SQL Processing Steps (src/sql/01_build.sql):**

1. **Data Source Views**: Direct CSV reading with DuckDB
2. **User-Product Aggregations**:
   ```sql
   -- Purchase frequency per user-product pair
   times_bought = COUNT(*) FROM prior_orders WHERE user_id=X AND product_id=Y
   
   -- Reorder rate calculation
   times_reordered = SUM(reordered) FROM prior_orders WHERE user_id=X AND product_id=Y
   user_prod_reorder_rate = times_reordered / NULLIF(times_bought, 0)
   ```

3. **Recency Features**:
   ```sql
   -- Last order containing this product
   last_prior_ordnum = MAX(order_number) WHERE user_id=X AND product_id=Y
   
   -- Orders since last purchase
   orders_since_last = user_max_order_num - last_prior_ordnum
   ```

4. **Behavioral Features**:
   ```sql
   -- Average cart position
   avg_add_to_cart_pos = AVG(add_to_cart_order) WHERE user_id=X AND product_id=Y
   
   -- Average days between user's orders
   avg_days_since_prior = AVG(days_since_prior_order) WHERE user_id=X
   ```

5. **Product Popularity**:
   ```sql
   -- Global product metrics
   prod_cnt = COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) WHERE product_id=Y
   prod_users = COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) WHERE product_id=Y
   ```

6. **Label Generation**:
   ```sql
   -- Binary reorder label from train set only
   y = CASE WHEN EXISTS(
       SELECT 1 FROM train_orders 
       WHERE user_id=X AND product_id=Y
   ) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END
   ```

#### Final Feature Schema (data/features/features.parquet)

```
user_id: int64                    # User identifier
product_id: int64                 # Product identifier
y: int32                          # Binary reorder label (0/1)

# User-Product Interaction Features
times_bought: int64               # Total purchase count
times_reordered: int64            # Reorder count (excludes first purchase)
user_prod_reorder_rate: float64   # Reorder rate for this user-product pair
last_prior_ordnum: int64          # Last order number containing product
orders_since_last: int64          # Recency: orders since last purchase
avg_add_to_cart_pos: float64      # Average position in shopping cart
avg_days_since_prior: float64     # Average days between user's orders

# Product Popularity Features  
prod_cnt: int64                   # Global product popularity (total orders)
prod_users: int64                 # Number of unique users who bought product

# Categorical Features
aisle_id: int64                   # Product aisle category
department_id: int64              # Product department category
```

**Feature Engineering Principles:**
- **Temporal Separation**: Only 'prior' orders used for features, 'train' orders for labels only
- **User-Centric**: Features capture individual user behavior patterns
- **Product Context**: Global popularity and categorical information
- **Recency Emphasis**: Recent behavior weighted more heavily than distant history
- **Leakage Prevention**: Strict validation that no future information influences features

### Data Quality and Validation

**Schema Validation (src/schemas/input_schemas.py):**
- Column presence and data type validation
- Value range and constraint checking
- Null rate and completeness monitoring
- Business rule validation

**Quality Reports (data/quality_reports/):**
- Row count validation and duplicate detection
- Data distribution analysis
- Constraint violation summaries
- Processing time and resource metrics

## Limitations and Future Improvements

### Current Limitations
1. **No Cold-Start Handling:** Cannot predict for new users or products not in training data
2. **Simple Thresholding:** Uses basic 0.5 threshold for binary predictions instead of optimized thresholds
3. **Minimal Hyperparameter Tuning:** Focus on getting working pipeline rather than optimal performance
4. **No Temporal Features:** Doesn't consider seasonality or time-of-day patterns
5. **Basic Feature Engineering:** Could benefit from more sophisticated interaction features

### Learning Project Focus
As a "studentisches Lernprojekt," this implementation prioritizes:
- **Understanding over Optimization:** Clear, readable code with extensive comments
- **End-to-End Pipeline:** Complete workflow from raw data to final report
- **Reproducibility:** Deterministic results with fixed random seeds
- **Educational Value:** Step-by-step explanations of ML pipeline decisions

### Potential Enhancements
- Advanced feature engineering (user behavior patterns, product similarity)
- Hyperparameter optimization with cross-validation
- Ensemble methods combining multiple models
- Cold-start handling for new users/products
- Real-time prediction API
- A/B testing framework for model deployment

## Security and Data Handling

### Data Security Guidelines

**Critical Security Measures:**
- **Original Instacart CSV files are NEVER committed to version control**
- All data processing happens locally - no external API calls or data transmission
- Comprehensive `.gitignore` rules prevent accidental data commits
- Clear data retention and cleanup policies

### Data Handling Policies

**Local Data Management:**
1. **Data Acquisition**: Download original Instacart dataset files to `data/raw/` directory
2. **Data Retention**: Keep raw data locally only during active development
3. **Data Cleanup**: Use `make clean` to remove intermediate and processed data files
4. **Version Control**: Only code, configuration, and documentation are committed

**Required Data Files** (place in `data/raw/`):
```
data/raw/
├── orders.csv                    # User order sequences
├── order_products__prior.csv     # Historical purchases (features)
├── order_products__train.csv     # Target purchases (labels)
├── products.csv                  # Product catalog
├── aisles.csv                    # Product aisle definitions
└── departments.csv               # Product department definitions
```

**Data Protection Measures:**
- Multiple `.gitignore` patterns to prevent CSV commits
- Explicit exclusion of all `*.csv` files except examples/samples
- Directory structure preserved with `.gitkeep` files
- Clear documentation of data handling requirements
